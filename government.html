                            <p class="lead">The future of shale gas extraction in Scotland is both compound and problematic, and very specific on all edges of the dispute.</p><p> 
                              The Scottish Government’s view of the matter is quite clear to get facts about fracking and let them discuss. In January 2015, the Scottish Government has established a moratorium on oil, gas expansion and coal bed methane extraction investigation against the possible effect on the natural, economic, and social environment.  The evidence is produced by an Expert Scientific Panel and special commissions supported with researching projects with more detail.<br><br>
                              The evidence has shown about Scotland the geology fact that the land in this country as the central belt is reached with huge reserves of shale gas, oil and coal bed methane. This particular place in Scotland is settled by the biggest population and significant productions and commercial which generate potential cost increasing to protect the natural environment and social concern about health.<br><br>
                              The Scottish Government moratorium concerning unconventional extraction of gas, oil and coal is so welcome in the public, especially by campaigners against this development. The minister of energy in Scotland Fergus Ewing announced 28 January 2015 that the government moratorium gives us the time to work on protentional solutions and consultations in the public as also find the best way of choosing the most friendly technology to extract the Scottish natural asset in the future without the unwanted impact of our life.<br><br>
                              The government now is taking the suggestion from the parties and industry companies like for example Ineos which is the owner of Grangemouth who is interested in licencing around the controversial central belt region.<br><br>
                              Director of Friends of the Earth Scotland Doctor Richard Dixon announced in July 2015 that this is a good time for people to gather evidence and stop this unwanted expansion. He is very happy about joining countries and regions like France, Ireland, Netherlands and New York State and many more where have stopped the shale gas extraction.<br><br>

                              According to Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone, Scotland should face national discussion to check all the material which must be gathered as evidence of the matter. There are a lot of people in the government like Labour leader Jim Murphy and the SNP party which demand a public consultation before any movement there.<br><br>
                              On 23/05/2018, the Scottish Government established a modern Climate Change Bill which much more forward to a 2009 similar Act. The new Act contains determined goals around the world for 2020, 2030 and 2040 and the IPCC report says that in 2050 the carbon dioxide emission must be reduced to net-zero. In April 2019 the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that the UK Committee on Climate Change recommended   Scotland to accomplish the net-zero target by 2045.<br><br>
                              Even the Scottish Government intentions are positive there still many questions about the gas extraction industry for example how long the moratorium will last and what next, some technical explanation from the industry, how to deal with the problems of gas extraction and processing in other countries where this industry is the most developed. The answers and much interesting information can be found here on the Scottish Government official website.<br><br>
