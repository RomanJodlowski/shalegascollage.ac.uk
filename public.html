                            <p class="lead">Scotland enforce a pause of shale gas extraction in 2015, however, what next, what happens to ordinary people living in potential fracking areas? Many people ask these questions and try to persuade the local authority to take into consideration their opinion.</p><p>
                              There is high resistance around the world as a lot of countries try to avoid this kind of gas exploitation it is mean people in Scotland are not alone. Ecologists opinion is radical they talk about the problems with pollution, water tables and typical local issues like rapidly raised traffic and noise.<br><br>
                              The United Kingdom, in general, is reached with shale gas in the underground that’s why central government and potential companies try to enforce and speed up the concessions, but locals have been slow this process. However, the government in some areas in England like Lancashire upturn local council verdict and allowed to start the development. In spite of the official ban from the central government this movement was not technically alive, some companies Cuadrilla was able to start gas extraction.<br><br>    
                              In Scotland this problem look much better after the moratorium, even the green organisations like Greenpeace and Friend of the Earth are enthusiastic about that Scottish Government decision, they said that “This is e huge win for the anti-fracking movement, particularly for those on the front line of this dirty industry here in Scotland, who have been working for a ban these last years”, Mary Church said. (The Guardian, Scottish government bans fracking after public opposition, 03/10/2017).<br><br>

                            <p>However, one of the biggest investor chemical company Ineos does big movement at Grangemount as the River Forth area and the North Sea as well. Their experts have the opposite view and said, “Reports have clearly stated that this technology can be applied safely and responsibly – but it will be England that reaps the benefits,” said Pickering. (The Guardian, Scottish government bans fracking after public opposition, 03/10/2017).<br><br>
                              One of the biggest and well-coordinated took place in 2020 next to the entrance to the Ineos oil and gas plant at Grangemouth in Falkirk. There was a big present of Extinction Rebellion Scotland activists which also were in London Ineos headquarter. In Falkirk activists have locked each other from them, they also used two boats at this protest, one at the Bo’ness Road gate and another one at the Ineos office on Inchyra Road. The main reason for the protests was realised by Scottish Environmental Protection Agency the report on The Ferret website pointed that Ineos as the biggest environmental poisoner in Scotland, they realised that the Grangemouth plant emitted 3.2 million tonnes of CO2 in 2019. Extinction Rebellion Scotland activists described their protests as “Actively cut emissions with our actions by shutting down the Ineos plant”. In the background of the action was another reason like import shale gas from the US to Grangemouth in spite of Scottish Government fracking moratorium.<br><br>
                              Outside Scotland, the biggest protest or even series of protests ware organised in Lancashire in England where one company has already started to extract the gas and their locals can feel series of earthquakes quite often so they obviously have the most real reason to stop drilling and back their life to normality.<br><br>
