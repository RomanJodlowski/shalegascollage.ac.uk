                            <p class="lead">The gas extraction companies cannot avoid risk caused by the environmental impact of their activities as a result of their activities. </p><p> One of the most important issues is water quality, there are three main points like groundwater which is quite significantly exposed to pollution from fracking, wastewater that is a similar problem to groundwater but in this case on the surface level and lasts one giant amount of water used to the process in general.<br><br>
                              The first time where one of the negative impacts was pointed in the public was the topic in October 2008, from the region in Pennsylvania where the gas development was very common the wasted water affected the salinity of the Monongahela River after that the local authority exerted pressure on the gas industry company to do their best to cleanse and isolate the wastewater using more advised technology.<br><br>
                              To improve extraction methods using during the process environmental regulators must progress much better technique of natural environment impact calculation and deliver appropriate documents to avoid any issues in the future. There is a big opportunity to develop the technology from experience to inspiration of shale gas progress around the world. Just only at the beginning of the drilling process is possible to minimalize the amount of water using by changing the procedure from horizontal well technology to vertical one and save on only one well 2000 m2 of the surface where the extraction takes place.<br><br>
                              In general, the underground gas is going over more than a few layers that are why the layers should be isolated properly to avoid moving wasted water between them and poisoning the groundwater or surface waters. The errors that provide to catastrophic could be caused by the absence of integrity of setting up casing formation.<br><br>

                            <p>Impact on creeks, rivers, streams, lakes and ponds could be the matter of leakage or spill of dirty water and even gas because of lack of loading volume, some errors during the process or rain and flood and obviously, the cost of the storage facilities which is rather big and some companies potentially try the cost exposing the same the natural environment to contamination.<br><br> 
                              Talking about air pollution is very important too in gas search and extraction it depends on the technology that has been using in the construction. At the beginning of this process, the pollution comes from the rig of fossil fuels and pumps which using additional drive like diesel engines, there must be mentioned the pollution from cars used during the construction process on the beginning and later to transport around the plant.<br><br>
                              There plays an important role in greenhouse gases emission. The fracking process is produced CO­2, NO2 and CH4. During the development the pollution is separated into well process development, drilling, extracting, finalising the development, wastewater process and making in general.
                              There are many other environmental impacts like noise especially in the beginning stage, landscape visual impact connected to facilities constructions like tanks, drilling towers, storages. Traffic problem in the local area if we talk plants with six wells there is around 90% bigger truck traffic than before. Earthquake in the local area is very often because of the hydraulic underground pressure, there is one report from the British Geological Society about the influence of the pressure on the microearthquakes. The last one is radiation because of the underground material carried on the surface with wastewater. The radiation is relatively small, however, over years the radiation is around 5 mrem in one hour and 100 mrem on 5 days which requires to deliver a special apparatus for employees.<br><br>
