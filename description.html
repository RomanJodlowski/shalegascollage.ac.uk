                            <p class="lead">The shale gas extraction in Scotland and some countries around the world have been debated very often, through governments and the public.</p><p> The importance of this research is to see if what rights are more supporting in the real world. I want to concentrate on fracking, this is another name of the gas extraction from rocks, an issue in Scotland ground. I also want to discuss the topics as the impact on the environment, economy, and society.<br><br>
                                Shale gas is known as unconventional natural gas, which consists of methane around sixty to ninety-five percent, there is also ethane and propane. The gas we can discover in some kind of rocks called shale rocks. The rocks were shaped during a Silurian time of Earth’s history, it was 400 – 450 million years ago.<br><br>
                                This gas normally is dry because fundamentally is built as methane combine with ethane and butane that is why mostly exist in water which is included in rocks. Shale usually exist in two types reservoir and source rocks aimed at the natural gas.<br><br>
                                The methane gas was made from the biological material hidden in the shale films where was kept all the time until now. When the source of energy has exposed the assets is able to move the geopolitical plan of energy making and shale gas supposed to be one of the main energy sources.<br><br> 
                                Hydrofracking is known as a contentious both oil and gas extraction method in the forties of the last century. This hydraulic procedure accurately means that millions of gallons of water with sand are hitting rock to open them for extracting the gas and oil on the ground. There is one issue it cannot be clear water, namely the water must be enriched with chemicals which is obviously dangerous to groundwater. In 2005 was agreed with a special Energy Policy Act which regulated this type of extraction with the Safe Drinking Water Act.<br><br>

                            <p>Because without any technical knowledge is impossible to get a reliable opinion, here are some facts about this kind of gas extraction. Because it is called hydraulic fracturing is obvious as was mentioned before to extract the gas from the rock is needed to use a huge amount of water that is why now is focus on the damage of chemically contaminated liquid and multi-stage fracturing methods. In connection with shale fracturing, liquid nitrogen is used to prevent the leak of the fluid. Pref-and-plug systems and ball-activated fracturing sleeves are used in multi-stage sector cracking it prevent the liquidation in high pressure as well.<br><br>
                                As it is shown here hydraulic fracturing need a lot of water which is one of the main problems of sourcing and removal of water. To compare one well is around one square kilometre which uses twenty thousand cubic meters of water which may affect the local water management, there still need to mention about the very high temperature of the liquid which seems to be partially solving of using a re-using circle.<br><br>
                                The price of shale gas extraction is worth mentioning especially in the current time when the climate requires our close attention, that is why it needs to consider what kind of wells is better to use the vertical or horizontal that need much more water and generate the cost.<br><br>
