                          Poor areas in Scotland, progress chance.
                      </div>
                        <div class="tm-media-body"><br>
                            <p class="lead">Oil and gas manufacturing in Scotland have a huge influence on the economy and there is possible to create 64,000 new jobs, much lower import, higher tax for the country and economic security. </p><p>The areas where the shale gas extraction will be placed have the most positive impact from new jobs and regional taxes and for all country lower prices of energy.<br><br> 
                              In 2017 one of the called UK Onshore Oil and Gas industry representative (UKOOG), has created a campaign to deliver proper information to the people who have lived central belt area where the extraction is supposed to be placed in the future. They try to persuade the Scottish Government and public opinion, however without any success as we can see now, which is negative from an economic point of view.<br><br> 
                              The best example of the lost opportunity is visible from the data like import within 20 years, whereas, over 75% the price of gas bill costing everyone over £300 it is mean all the money went out of the country.<br><br>
                              Talking about the 20 years it could be compared to income from annual shale gas companies’ tax as all the council tax which is paid in Stirling, Falkirk, and Fife it is roughly 2% of Scottish income tax.<br><br> 
                               Another ridiculous point of the debate is the climate change discussion around the world and in the UK where the government's decisions to cut development of the most profitable industry to meet the carbon emission targets. It is a misunderstanding to ruin the economy whereas countries where the UK is importing the gas or oil from have not met any climate restrictions and even more, they take the most profitable benefits while the British people plunging into poverty, paying more and more from using gas and oil.<br><br>

                    <article class="col-lg-6 tm-media">
                        <div class="tm-media-body">
                            <p>The next reason for developing the gas industry is the number of individual people and businesses using gas or oil to exist and create goods. There are two million homes and over 22,000 commercials using the sours of energy, it is 78% domestic heating and 43% gas used by businesses.<br><br> 
                              As it is not complicated to see from the above examples there is no reason to sacrifice Scottish and people in general just only of climate change propaganda.<br><br> 
                              The KPMG audit company report used Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC)  2015 data of the price forecast has predicted between 2022 – 2040 as 43 pence per them, however, the price prediction in 2017 increased to 50 – 52 pence per them between 2018- 2023 so, the data which has been used by the authority was unreal but the government did not reconsider their decision.<br><br> 
                              In conclusion, the balance among officials decisions and economic expectations have not been met that is why people despite some dangers from hydraulic gas exploitation, should demand new data and proper decision from governments in Scotland. More importantly because the future belongs to them and their children but not to politicians who take the profits from the pro-climate change lobby with unknown intentions.<br><br>
